### What it does


In this project, we will create a streamlit dashboard to visualize our data. This dashboard provides an interactive visualization of storm events across the United States in the year 2024, based on data from the National Weather Service's Storm Events Database. It allows users to explore the human and economic impact of various severe weather phenomena—including tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and more—throughout the year.

Specifically, the dashboard enables users to:

* **Analyze injuries** (both direct and indirect) caused by storms, filtered by storm type, state, and month.
* **Explore fatalities** (direct and indirect) associated with different weather events across states and over time.
* **Visualize property and crop damage**, showing the financial impact of storms by category and location.
* **View a U.S. map** displaying average injuries, deaths, and damages by state, offering a geographic perspective on storm severity.

This tool is designed to support emergency planners, researchers, and the general public in understanding the scope and distribution of storm impacts, helping to inform disaster preparedness and response efforts.
